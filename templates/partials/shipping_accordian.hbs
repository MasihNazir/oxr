                <p>Some countries require exporters to complete the designated inspections prior to filing an export
                    declaration.
                    When mud or other foreign material is present on the car body or tires, or plants or seeds are found
                    inside a car at customs in the destination country, customs clearance may not be permitted. Or,
                    costs for cleaning or disinfecting may incur, leading to complaints or claims from the importer.
                    Therefore, your cars must be cleaned sufficiently before exporting.

                    Upon the request from customers, Sun Phoenix will perform car cleaning and/or inspection services at
                    the SPX yard.

                    Currently, we are not providing any inspection services for cargo for export to countries in Africa.
                    Please contact our sales representative for details and prices of our agency services.

                        <h5>Export customs clearance</h5>
                        <p class="card-text">Customers need to prepare an invoice, which must include information such
                            as the type of car, vehicle identification number, model year, type of fuel (gasoline or
                            diesel) and engine displacement.
                            The customs inspection may take some time. So, please reserve cargo space considering the
                            time until customs clearance is complete. In particular, when the contract is on FOB basis
                            and the buyer has designated the ship, customers need to make sure that customs clearance is
                            finished by its departure date.

                            If any devices other than standard accessories and equipment are present inside a car or in
                            the trunk, it would be in violation of Customs Law. This may lead to the cancelation of
                            export permission of the used car. For example, when a car stereo is provided free of charge
                            separately (not installed), you need to write that information in the invoice, like "Car
                            stereo 1 piece Â¥1,000 (No Value)."
                            On the day following the day of the ship's departure, we will issue to the customer a bill
                            that includes information such as the departure date of the vessel, destination, details of
                            the car(s), ocean freight and shipping charges</p>

                            time, we will return to you the certificate of temporally registration cancellation for
